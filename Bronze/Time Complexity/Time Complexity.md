# Time Complexity

## Introduction

Time Complexity plays a crucial role in optimizing programs and excelling in programming competitions. Understanding how the time complexity of an algorithm affects its performance is vital for writing efficient code. In USACO, a popular competitive programming platform, it's common to have a time limit of 2 seconds for C++ submissions. To ensure your programs run within this limit, it's essential to have a firm grasp of time complexity analysis.

## Notations

### Big O Notation

Big O notation is a standardized way of expressing the worst-case time complexity of an algorithm. It quantifies how the runtime of an algorithm scales as the size of the input, denoted as 'n,' becomes arbitrarily large. The Big O notation provides an upper bound on the running time, helping us understand how an algorithm's efficiency degrades with larger input sizes.
