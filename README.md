~~This will be a hair-pulling repo (literally)~~.
## Introduction
Welcome to the "Algorithm_Notes" repository!
This repository is my personal space where I organize and share the algorithms I've learned and am exploring. It's created as a helpful resource for anyone interested in algorithms, whether you're just starting out or looking for more advanced topics. Here, you'll find a range of algorithms, from basic to complex, along with explanations and examples. It's a place for learning, discovery, and perhaps even a bit of inspiration for your own coding journey. So, if you're in front of your screen wondering about algorithms, this is the right spot for you!

As my primary focus is competing in the USA Computing Olympics (USACO) using C++, you'll find that most of the programs in this repository are written in C++. However, from time to time, I will also post pseudocode for various problems. These snippets are meant to spark your thought process and provide a deeper understanding of algorithmic concepts, regardless of the specific programming language you're familiar with.
