# Algorithm_Notes

## Introduction
This repository is for algorithm organizing. I will organize all the algorithms I've studied, and I am currently looking. This repo is created for me and may help you who is sitting in front of the screen.

Since I am competing for USACO(USA Computing Olympics) in C++, the program in this repo will be the majority of C++.
